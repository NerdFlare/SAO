These are znjp's SAO v1.69bis symbol and footprints for SAO (male) and Badge (female) connectors.

Remember, the SAO footprint is designed to go on the BACK of the board, so that pin 1 (3.3V) is in the upper right hand corner when looking at the back of the board. From the front of the board 3.3V will be in the upper left. 

The Badge footprint should be placed on the FRONT of the board.
